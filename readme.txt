## run Graphlan on the food tree input

## First you need Graphlan on your local computer
## Get it here: https://bitbucket.org/nsegata/graphlan/wiki/Home

## I have best luck running it within a conda environment
## conda was set up as follows:

## $ conda create --name graphlan python=2.7 biopython matplotlib

## activate the conda environment
source activate graphlan

# navigate to correct dir
cd /Users/abby/Documents/Projects/Food_tree_related/Diet_study_graphlan

# to make the plot with annotation file
#graphlan_annotate.py --annot annotation.txt mct.tree.txt mct.tree.xml
#graphlan.py mct.tree.1.xml food_tree.png --dpi 300 --size 7

# just need to do the following to get this to run
# bash run.sh

# thoughts for further development
Really need to flesh out the lower levels of the tree so that they are more detailed
What is the best way to do this? Itâ€™s going to require some manual curation, obviously
Add more L2 categories
Should the tree only contain items that are in the dataset?
